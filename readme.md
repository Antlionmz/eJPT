Tools (that I used) not included in the INE training:
autorecon         #An absolute time saver, must get not just for eJPT but for OSCP!
cherrytree        #one-note like note taking tool. very useful


Pivot:
ip route show
ip add <network1> via <ip1> dev <device>
ip del <network1> via <ip...>
#Most linux-level routers only take one route per network. use ip del to get rid of the conflicting networks.
